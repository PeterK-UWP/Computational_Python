    "\t%The unknowns one wishes to solve from the 2D Navier-Stokes is the velocity vector field $\\vec{u}(x, y, t)$ and the pressure gradient $\\vec{\\nabla}p(x, y)$. This nonlinear partial differential equation has one time derivative and two spacial derivatives in $\\vec{u}(x, y, t)$ followed by two spacial derivatives in $p(x, y)$. For the initial condition in time, we will assume the fluid is at rest everywhere at time $t=0$. This also means that the pressure in the fluid is $0$ everywhere. For the boundary conditions of $\\vec{u}(x, y, t)$, the fluid should reflect off the container, thus one will apply homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions to the velocity vector field everywhere except the top of the cavity, where a second fluid will be driving the systems at some horizontal velocity. One will also enact homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on the pressure gradient.\n",
